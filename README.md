## MODELLING
To understand the structure of the database, I visualise the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that maps out the tables and their connections. This diagram clarifies how the tables, **employee performance** and **employee test**, are organized and interact with each other. Using the ERD as a guide, I can see how data flows between these tables, making it easier to analyze employee performance and identify factors influencing attrition and training needs. This clear structure is essential for accurate and effective analysis throughout the project.

### Diagnostic Analytics (Employee Performance)
This diagnostic analysis focuses on employee performance regarding training scores. The first query identifies the highest average training score, which is achieved by only two employees, both scoring 97. The second query examines the average training scores across departments, revealing that the R&D and Analytics departments lead with scores of 84.83 and 84.82, respectively. In contrast, the Sales and Marketing department has the lowest average score at 49.84. These insights are crucial for identifying areas for improvement in training and development initiatives.

This query reveals the average training scores of employees based on their education levels, indicating that those with a Master's degree or higher have the highest average score of 65.0, followed by employees with a Bachelor's degree at 63.3. In contrast, employees with an N/A designation have the lowest average score at 57.9. The second query highlights the average performance ratings from the previous year by recruitment channel, showing that employees recruited through referrals received the highest rating of 3.82, followed by those sourced through other channels, which averaged a rating of 3.32. These findings provide valuable insights into the relationship between education, recruitment channels, and employee performance.

## RECOMMENDATION
Based on the insights drawn from the **employee performance and employee test** datasets, here are some data-driven recommendations to help control employee attrition at **Emerald Technologies:**

- **Enhance Job Satisfaction Initiatives**: Since the HR department reported the highest job satisfaction rating, consider leveraging their practices across other departments. Implement regular feedback mechanisms, employee engagement surveys, and recognition programs to boost morale and job satisfaction in lower-rated areas like R&D.
  
- **Focus on Employee Training and Development**: With lower average training scores in some departments, enhance training programs to ensure employees have the necessary skills and support to excel. Tailor training initiatives based on performance ratings and feedback, particularly for those with lower scores, to increase engagement and reduce turnover.

- **Targeted Retention Strategies for High-Turnover Departments**: Given that Sales and Marketing have the highest attrition rate, develop specific retention programs for these departments. This could include career development opportunities, competitive compensation packages, and targeted mentorship programs to support employee growth and satisfaction.

- **Strengthen Recruitment Practices**: Since employees hired through referrals received higher ratings, encourage current employees to refer potential candidates. This could lead to improved cultural fit and job satisfaction, thereby reducing attrition rates.

- **Analyze Regional Disparities**: Address the high attrition rate in Region 2 by conducting exit interviews to understand the underlying causes of departures. Tailor retention strategies to the unique challenges faced in that region, such as work-life balance, managerial support, or local market conditions.

- **Regular Performance Reviews**: Implement structured performance reviews that focus on employee development and provide actionable feedback. This can help employees feel more engaged and valued, reducing the likelihood of attrition.

- **Implement Flexible Work Options**: To enhance job satisfaction and attract diverse talent, consider offering flexible work arrangements or remote work options, especially in departments with lower satisfaction ratings.

By applying these recommendations, **Emerald Technologies** can create a more supportive work environment that addresses the root causes of attrition and enhances overall employee satisfaction.
